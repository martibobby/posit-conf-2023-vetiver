## Overview

These are the materials for a one-day workshop on [MLOps with vetiver](https://vetiver.rstudio.com/) on Monday, 18 Sept at [posit::conf 2023](http://pos.it/conf)!

Many data scientists understand what goes into training a machine learning or statistical model, but creating a strategy to deploy and maintain that model can be daunting. In this workshop, learn what MLOps (machine learning operations) is, what principles can be used to create a practical MLOps strategy, and what kinds of tasks and components are involved. We’ll use vetiver, a framework for MLOps tasks in Python and R, to version, deploy, and monitor the models you have trained and want to deploy and maintain in production reliably and efficiently.

## Is this workshop for me? 

We expect participants to have exposure to basic modeling and machine learning practice, but NOT expert familiarity with advanced ML or MLOps topics. This workshop is for you if you:

- have intermediate R or Python knowledge (this will be a “choose your own adventure” workshop where you can work through the exercises in either R or Python)
- can read data from CSV and other flat files, transform and reshape data, and make a wide variety of graphs
- can fit a model to data with your modeling framework of choice
wide variety of graphs

## Prework

ADD INFORMATION YOU WANT LEARNERS TO HAVE / STEPS THEY WANT THEM TO
COMPLETE PRIOR TO THE WORKSHOP. THIS COULD BE A LINK TO A THREAD ON
RSTUDIO COMMUNITY, PACKAGE INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS, HOW TO GET AN
RSTUDIO.CLOUD ACCOUNT, ETC.

## Instructor

Julia Silge is a software engineer at Posit PBC focusing on open source MLOps tools, as well as an author and international keynote speaker. Julia loves making beautiful charts, Jane Austen, and her two cats.

Isabel Zimmerman is also a software engineer on the open source team at Posit PBC, where she works on building MLOps frameworks. When she's not geeking out over new data science techniques, she can be found hanging out with her dog or watching Marvel movies.
