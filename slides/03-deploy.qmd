## Plan for this workshop

::: nonincremental
-   *Versioning*
    -   Managing change in models âœ…
-   *Deploying*
    -   Putting models in REST APIs ðŸŽ¯
-   *Monitoring*
    -   Tracking model performance ðŸ‘€
:::

# Where does vetiver work?

-   Posit's pro products, like [Connect](https://posit.co/products/enterprise/connect/)

-   AWS SageMaker (R only, for now)

-   A public or private cloud, using Docker

# Docker

tktk

# Deploy preprocessors and models together

tktk more substantive feature engineering (like with learned transformation from training data)

## What is wrong with this?

# Model metrics as metadata

tktk like https://vetiver.rstudio.com/learn-more/metrics-metadata.html

Transition to model monitoring at end
