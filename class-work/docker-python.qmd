## Choose a pinned model to deploy

```{python}
import pins
from vetiver import VetiverModel
raw = "https://colorado.rstudio.com/rsc"
paths = {"chicago-model-python": "chicago-model-python/"}
board = pins.board_url(raw, paths, allow_pickle_read=True)

VetiverModel.from_pin(board,"chicago-model-python")
```

## Create artifacts to run a Dockerfile

```{python}
import vetiver

vetiver.prepare_docker(
    board = board, 
    pin_name = "chicago-model-python",
    version = None
)
```

What outputs are created?

## Build your container

```bash
docker build -t inspections .
```

## Run your container

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 inspections
```

## Make predictions

```{python}
endpoint = vetiver.vetiver_endpoint(url = ___)
vetiver.predict(endpoint = ___, data = ___)
```
