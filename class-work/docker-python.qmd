## Choose a pinned model to deploy

```{python}
import pins
from vetiver import VetiverModel

board = pins.board_url("https://colorado.posit.co/rsc/", {'chicago-inspections-python':'/chicago-inspections-model-py/'}, allow_pickle_read = True)

VetiverModel.from_pin(board,"chicago-inspections-python")
```

## Create artifacts to run a Dockerfile

```{python}
import vetiver

vetiver.prepare_docker(
    board = board, 
    pin_name = "chicago-inspections-python",
    version = None
)
```

What outputs are created?

docker build -t inspections .
```

## Run your container

vetiver.predict(endpoint = ___, data = ___)
```
